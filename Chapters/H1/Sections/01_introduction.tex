Juno is a NASA spacecraft orbiting Jupiter. Built by Lockheed Martin and operated by NASA, it was launched by an Atlas V551 on the $5^{th}$ of August 2011. After 5 years, during which many maneuvers occurred, including an Earth flyby, Juno entered a polar orbit around Jupiter and started its observation, which lasts to this day. Its aim is to study the planet to understand its composition and evolution, analyzing its gravitational and magnetic fields and its atmosphere dynamics. The mission should have ended in 2017, but is still ongoing and it will end with a de-orbit that will destroy the spacecraft into the planet's atmosphere to avoid contaminating the environment.
