\subsection{Launch and cruise}
\label{sec: lancio e crociera}

The spacecraft was launched into orbit with an Atlas V 551 from Cape Canaveral. The actual launch date belonged to a 21-day time window limited by a number of events and their timings such as the Deep Space Maneuvers, the Earth Flyby, the Jupiter Insertion and the science orbits.

Following the launch, after booster separation, Juno was put in a parking orbit around Earth thanks to a first burn of the Centaur upper stage. Afterwards, at time L+645 $s$, via a second burn given by the same stage, Juno entered an heliocentric trajectory. Solar arrays were deployed and initial checks on the instruments were performed at this time.
The specific trajectory followed by Juno is called "2+ dV-EGA", which means that the spacecraft will perform an Earth gravity assist at around two years after launch.
During the initial cruise various correction maneuvers were performed: the main ones being the two DSMs needed to place Juno on the correct path to achieve the planned fly-by. 
DSMs were performed near the apocentre, located farther away from the Sun than Mars' orbit, causing the spacecraft to pass as close al 0.88 $AU$ before approching Earth. 

The fly-by around Earth occurs on the $10^{th}$ of September 2013 and puts the spacecraft on its final trajectory to Jupiter. Particularly, the fly-by gave the 7.3 $km/s$, avoiding a burn of the Leros 1b main engine of Juno.
