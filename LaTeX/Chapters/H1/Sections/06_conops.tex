%\textcolor{red}{
The Mission ConOps serve as a roadmap for planning and executing a mission. The trajectory correction maneuvers, the communications science operations and data transfer are not continuous operations as shown in \autoref{fig:ConOps}, but are performed throughout the shown time interval.
The mission was extended from 2018 until 2021 in order to achieve the principal goals guaranteeing the security of instruments. Moreover a second extension was approved to obtain more insight about Jupiter that will last up until September 2025.
