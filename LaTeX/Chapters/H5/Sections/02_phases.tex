\section{Analysis of thermal conditions along the mission}
\label{sec:TCS_phases}

Different thermal conditions have been encountered by Juno during its cruise. In previous chapters, the mission was divided into phases by different attitude and communication constraints. These phases will be now grouped by the means of thermal constraints to better analyze their evolution during the mission time.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TP-1}:
    in this first phase, which comprehends both LEOP and IC 1, the S/C is in SPM due to thermal and power requirements. In particular, since the trajectory is relatively close to the Sun, Juno has to protect the vault with the HGA (as already explained in the previous chapter).
    It is a hot phase but not the most critical one and so it will not be considered in the following analysis.

    \item \textbf{TP-2}:
    
    
    \item \textbf{TP-3}:
    
    
    \item \textbf{TP-4}:
    
    
    \item \textbf{TP-5}:
    
    
    \item \textbf{TP-6}:
    
    
\end{itemize}
