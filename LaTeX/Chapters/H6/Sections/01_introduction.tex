The Thermal Control System of Juno adopts various strategies in order to maintain the instrumentation within operative ranges of temperature. This is done through both active and passive systems, which will be analyzed in \autoref{sec:TCS_architecture_rationale}.
First thing first, an analysis of the mission will be conducted to enlighten the thermal conditions the satellite is exposed to, which range from really hot environment nearby the Sun to extremely cold environment nearby Jupiter.
A selection of the two most extreme situations will be done through a preliminary evaluation of the heat fluxes in these phases.
In the light of this, the architecture of the Juno's TCS will be studied and justified through a brief rationale analysis.
Finally, a reverse sizing will be carried out imposing some simplifying assumptions in order to find the temperatures on Juno and to verify the compliance with its mission.
