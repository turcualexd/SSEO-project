\section{Introduction of EPS}
\label{sec:EPS_introduction}

The Electric Power System of Juno adopts a solar-based energy source to provide enough power through the various conditions encountered during the mission, which ranges from low to high energy request around Jupiter, periods of eclipse, high radiation environment and more.
This chapter will study firstly the complex requirements coming from the other subsystems and from the environment encountered, then a brief rationale of the adopted architecture will be treated.
In the end, a reverse sizing of the primary and secondary sources (solar panels and batteries) will be carried out to check the compliance with the mission.
