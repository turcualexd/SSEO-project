\subsection{Introduction of OBDH}
\label{subsec:OBDH_inroduction}

Given the long term exposure of the S/C to extreme environments, such as the one around Jupiter characterized by high levels of radiation, Juno's OBDH system was designed to ensure proper functioning up to EOM. This was achieved by selecting radiation hardened hardware characterized by high TRL. The OBDH system also needs to constantly interact with all other subsystems to handle both telemetry and scientific data.
