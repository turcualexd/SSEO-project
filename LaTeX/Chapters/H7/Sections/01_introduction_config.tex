\section{Introduction of Juno's configuration}
\label{sec:config_introduction}

Juno is the first spin-stabilized solar-powered spacecraft to conduct science operations around Jupiter, featuring different instruments with various requirements and limitations. Given the harsh environment it faces around the planet, the longevity of the mission and the required power to conduct operations, both packed and unpacked configuration of the payloads, antennas, internal hardware and power sources required special attention. Mass distribution is also a critical factor in the accuracy of the different measurement as Juno spins at 2 RPM during science operations.
