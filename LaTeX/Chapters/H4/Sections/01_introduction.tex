\section{Introduction of AOCS}
\label{sec:AOCS_introduction}

The Attitude and Orbital Control System of Juno comprehends various sensors and actuators that are vital to maintain the satellite in operability conditions and to execute all the basic tasks.
In this chapter, the main modes of the satellite are deduced through the analysis of the mission already done in previous chapters. These modes will be then arranged on the timeline consequently.
Based on the identified modes and pointing budget, the architecture of the actual system will be presented and then progressively analyzed, verifying the compliance with the previously found requirements.
Finally, a reverse sizing of AOCS will be carried out.
